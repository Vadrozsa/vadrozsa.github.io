                <h3>3. Solutions and Plant Care Tips</h3>
                <p>Now that you know what problems and pests can harm your plants, let’s explore how to keep them healthy!</p>

                <h4>Proper Watering</h4>
                <p>Each plant has different water needs. Overwatering is one of the most common mistakes, leading to root rot. Make sure the soil is well-draining, and only water when the top inch of soil is dry. Consider using a moisture meter for accuracy.</p>

                <h4>Providing Adequate Light</h4>
                <p>Light is essential for plant growth. Some plants need bright indirect light, while others thrive in low light. Identify your plant’s light requirements and place it in an appropriate spot. If natural light is insufficient, consider using grow lights.</p>

                <h4>Maintaining Proper Humidity</h4>
                <p>Tropical plants require higher humidity levels. Increase humidity by misting your plants, using a humidifier, or placing a tray with pebbles and water beneath the pot.</p>

                <h4>Nutrient Supply</h4>
                <p>Plants need essential nutrients to thrive. Use a balanced fertilizer suited to your plant type. Organic fertilizers such as compost or worm castings can provide slow-release nutrients, while liquid fertilizers give an instant boost.</p>
                
                <h4>Pest Prevention and Treatment</h4>
                <p>Regularly inspect plants for pests. For minor infestations, use insecticidal soap or neem oil. If the problem is severe, systemic insecticides or biological controls (such as ladybugs for aphids) may be needed. Keeping plants clean and trimming affected areas also helps prevent further spread.</p>

                <h4>Repotting and Soil Care</h4>
                <p>Over time, soil becomes compacted and loses nutrients. Repot plants every 1-2 years using fresh soil suited to the plant species. Ensure proper drainage by using pots with drainage holes and adding perlite or sand to improve aeration.</p>

                <h4>Seasonal Adjustments</h4>
                <p>In winter, plants often need less water due to slower growth. During summer, they may require more frequent watering and protection from direct sunlight. Adjust your care routine according to seasonal changes.</p>


                <p>We provide illustrated guides to help you implement these solutions effectively!</p>
